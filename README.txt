Introduction
============

The *About* tab on the *Group* page provides some general information about
the group. This product supplies two things: a `viewlet`_ for the Group
page, and the `change Page`_ that allows the contents of the viewlet to be
altered.

Viewlet
=======

The *About Viewlet* is displayed in the main part the Group page [#group]_.
Because the position of the About tab is so valuable multiple products may
want to show there. To allow this the About viewlet contains a viewlet
manager, ``gs.group.about.interfaces.IGroupAboutInfo``, which other
products can supply viewlets for.

The "normal" text of the About page is a viewlet that uses the
``IGroupAboutInfo`` manager. It gets its content from the ``aboutText``
property of the group. A more button [#more]_ is used to stop the content
of the About Viewlet overwhelming the page.

Another viewlet is used to link to `Change Page`_ if the viewer is a group
administrator.

Change Page
===========

The *Change About* page is a simple form that changes the ``aboutText``
property of the group. This module provides the *Change* page itself â€” and
the link from the *Properties* list in the *Admin* tab on the *Group* page
to the *Change* page. Most group-property pages can only be changed by the
site administrator, but an exception is made for the *About*, which can be
changed by the group administrator.
